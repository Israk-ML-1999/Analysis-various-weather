# Analysis-various-weather
The project involves analyzing hourly weather observations using Python and data analysis libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib. The dataset contains various weather parameters recorded at different times, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation amount, and pressure. The main objectives are to perform (EDA),

Calculate the average values for the following parameters over the entire timespan covered in the data, disregarding any NaN and other non-numeric values:

Relative Humidity
Temperature Average
Wind Speed
Precipitation Amount
Pressure Average
Perform the following tasks using NumPy:

For each parameter, calculate the minimum, maximum, and median values.
Find the hour with the highest value for each parameter.

Create plots to visualize the trends of the following parameters over time:

Relative Humidity
Temperature Average
Wind Speed
Precipitation Amount
Pressure Average
